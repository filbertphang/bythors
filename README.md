# bythors

a rust library for running protocols defined with [`bythos` (now `veil`, previously `LeanSts`)](https://github.com/verse-lab/veil)

## current status

extremely WIP

**TODOs before the next milestone:**

- detect when consensus is achieved for a round, and implement callback handling
- improve network driver user API
- review all the other 'TODO's left in the code (of which there are a lot of)
- ensure no memory leaks
